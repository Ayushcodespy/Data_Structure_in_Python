<h2 style="color: red;">Bubble Sort</h2>
<b>Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.</b>
<h4>Algorithm: </h4>
- traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. <br>
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. <br>
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.<br>

<h2>Selection Sort</h2>
<b>The Selection Sort algorithm finds the lowest value in an array and moves it to the front of the array.</b>
<h4>Algorithm: </h4>
- Go through the array to find the lowest value.<br>
- Move the lowest value to the front of the unsorted part of the array.<br>
- Go through the array again as many times as there are values in the array.<br>
<hr>
<h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
<b>The Insertion Sort algorithm uses one part of the array to hold the sorted values, and the other part of the array to hold values that are not sorted yet.</b>
<h4>Algorithm: </h4>
- Take the first value from the unsorted part of the array.<br>
- Move the value into the correct place in the sorted part of the array.<br>
- Go through the unsorted part of the array again as many times as there are values.<br>
