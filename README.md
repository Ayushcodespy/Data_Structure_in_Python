<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
<h4>Algorithm: </h4>
- traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. <br>
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. <br>
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.<br>
